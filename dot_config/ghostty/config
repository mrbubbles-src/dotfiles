# path ~/.config/ghostty/config

# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.

#

# This template file has been automatically created at the following

# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:

#

# /Users/mrbubbles/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config

#

# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships

# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set

# options that they want to change from the default.

#

# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of

# all available config options and their default values.

#

# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail

# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course

# ==========================

# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,

# # separated by equals signs.

# font-family = Iosevka

# window-padding-x = 2

#

# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.

# # All of these are identical:

# key=value

# key= value

# key =value

# key = value

#

# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put

# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a

# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":

# background = #123abc

#

# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.

# key =

#

# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,

# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.

# # Just for example:

# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms
